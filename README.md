# -Similarity-Based-Modeling-for-Rotating-Machine-Fault-Identification

This repository contains the project where I implemented a research paper on similarity-based modeling for rotating-machine fault identification. I have used the open source MAFAULDA vibration dataset which contains vibration data for a rotating machine in normal condition and when subjected to 5 different faults types. The main idea is to extract time-domain and frequency-domain features using statistical and digital signal processing techniques from the time series of the vibration sensor data and then use a similarity measure to identify the fault type of a new incoming feature.
